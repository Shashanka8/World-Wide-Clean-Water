                        and families we serve, financial supporters of our mission, supporters under the age of 18, and

                    <h1 style="text-align: center;">General User Privacy Policy</h1>
                    <p>This privacy policy applies to general users of the WWCW website and describes how WWCW protects
                        information you provide when you use this website.</p>
                    <p>Although elements of this policy may apply to the veterans we serve, their caregivers, and our
                        donors
                        who visit our website, we do collect additional data from these groups of people. Warriors and
                        their
                        caregivers who register for WWCW’s programs and services can find additional information about
                        how
                        WWCW uses their information on our Alumni and Caregiver Privacy Policy. Donors and supporters of
                        WWCW can find additional information about how WWCW uses their information on our Donor Privacy
                        Policy.
                        Both policies may be found below.</p>
                    <p>WWCW is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. It is our goal that you fully
                        understand how we collect information, how we use that information, and the steps we’ve taken to
                        protect that information. We will update this policy from time to time, so make sure to check
                        this
                        page periodically. If you have any questions about this policy, please email us at
                        <a href="mailto:wwcwlegal@worldwidecleanwater.org">wwcwlegal@worldwidecleanwater.org.</a></p>
                    <h1>What type of information does WWCW collect?</h1>
                    <p>There are two basic types of information that WWCW might collect: personal and non-personal
                        information.</p>
                    <p>As you browse the WWCW website, you may opt to provide WWCW with personal information. Personal
                        information is information that contains identifiers such as your name, address, phone number,
                        or
                        email address.</p>
                    <p>WWCW may also collect non-personal information from you such as an internet protocol address
                        (typically referred to as an “IP address” and defined below) and browsing variables (like your
                        web
                        browser, referral links, or how much time you spent at our website). Although this information
                        may
                        on rare occasion be used to identify you, WWCW typically uses this information to improve your
                        experience and the experience of other visitors to our website. WWCW may use cookies to collect
                        this
                        type of information.</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s a cookie? </strong>A cookie is a small data text file that individual websites
                        store
                        on your computer’s hard drive – if your web browser permits. The website can later retrieve that
                        cookie to let us know you’ve been to our site before. Cookies typically make your use of the
                        site
                        easier, make the site run more smoothly, and help us to maintain a secure site. Many websites
                        use
                        cookies. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site
                        may
                        not work properly if you do that.</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s an IP address? </strong>An IP address is a unique number, assigned to each and
                        every
                        computer and other device on the Internet. Your computer, your phone, your e-reader, and other
                        electronic devices, are all assigned IP addresses.</p>
                    <h1>When does WWCW collect this information?</h1>
                    <p>We collect non-personal information from you as you use any of the pages on our website. We
                        collect
                        personal information from you only when you specifically provide it to us – for example, if you
                        fill
                        out a form or send us an email.</p>
                    <h1>How does WWCW use the information we collect?</h1>
                    <p>WWCW uses information from different site visitors in different ways. We generally use
                        information
                        provided to us through the donation process in accordance with the Donor Privacy Policy; we
                        generally use</p>
                    <p>information provided to us by the warriors and caregivers we serve in accordance with the Alumni
                        and
                        Caregiver Privacy Policy. Both policies may be found below.</p>
                    <p>On rare occasion, we use personal information provided by general users of our website who are
                        not
                        warriors or caregivers and are not engaging in the donation process. We might, for example, ask
                        for
                        your information if you contact a local WWCW representative or if you upload a personal video
                        message to our warriors.</p>
                    <p>We may also use your personal and non-personal information in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entering your information into our databases for internal record keeping, reporting, and
                            data
                            analysis;</li>
                        <li>Communicating with you to obtain your input, provide information about our programs and
                            events,
                            or request contributions (provided you have opted to receive such communications);</li>
                        <li>Improving our programs and services;</li>
                        <li>Customizing our website according to your interests;</li>
                        <li>Sharing information with third parties who help us manage our website and databases, and who
                            assist us with our marketing efforts; and</li>
                        <li>Sharing information with third parties as required by law, or a part of a legal process;
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We have contracted with Yahoo, and other online marketing companies, to monitor certain pages of
                        our
                        website for the purpose of reporting web traffic, statistics, advertisement “click-throughs,”
                        and
                        other activities on our website. No personally identifiable data is transferred to Yahoo by us.
                        Where authorized by us, Yahoo may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile
                        anonymous statistics about our website visitors.</p>
                    <p>If you choose, you may opt out from Yahoo’s collection of such information outside of the Yahoo
                        distribution network by clicking on the following link: <a

                    </p>
                    <p>We also reserve the right to use non-personal information, such as an IP address, to identify a
                        user
                        when we believe it is necessary to protect the compelling interests of our websites, the
                        warriors we
                        serve, their caregivers, our donors, our employees, or others, or to comply with laws, court
                        orders,
                        or law enforcement requests.</p>
                    <h1>Does WWCW share my information?</h1>
                    <p>WWCW may share your personal and non-personal information as discussed herein. We do not,
                        however,
                        sell or rent the personal information of our general website users for profit.</p>
                    <h1>Does WWCW track my online activity while I’m not on the WWCW site?</h1>
                    <p>Cookies and other technology may be used to track non-personal information about your
                        web-browsing
                        habits. For example, if a significant portion of our visitors all browse to the same website
                        immediately after visiting us, we may use this information to improve your experience at our
                        site.
                    </p>
                    <p>WWCW respects web browser “do not track” signals and other mechanisms that provide you the
                        ability to
                        opt out of having your personal information or online activities collected. But remember, unless
                        you
                        have selected the “do not track” function in your web browser, third parties (not just WWCW) may
                        collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different
                        websites.
                    </p>
                    <h1>How does WWCW secure my personal information?</h1>
                    <p>WWCW is committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure. Your trust in us is
                        important, so we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard
                        and
                        secure the information we collect. Records containing personal information are stored at secure
                        facilities; our websites use SSL (a tool used to verify the legitimacy of a website); and our
                        employees
                        are provided training on how to treat your data securely.</p>
                    <h1>Will you contact me if I give WWCW my information?</h1>
                    <p>If you provide us with your contact information, we may provide you with information about how
                        you
                        can help this generation of injured veterans. However, if you would not like to receive these
                        messages, you can opt out of having your personal information used for certain purposes when we
                        ask
                        for your contact information.</p>
                    <p>If you are already receiving those messages and would like to stop receiving them, you may opt
                        out by

                    <h1>Links to other websites and third party services</h1>
                    <p>Sometimes we’ll provide you with a link to another website or service. We typically do this in
                        order
                        to provide you additional information about one of our sponsors to others who support the
                        mission of
                        WWCW.</p>
                    <p>WWCW may also include other electronic services on our website. For example, this could include a
                        tool that allows you to contact your local politicians, or to create a custom message to send to
                        veterans. These services are typically provided by third parties, and may require you to agree
                        to
